Scripts and data from West Virginia University investigative journalism class in Fall 2019.

### Crime Log

Basic scraper for the WVU campus police [crime log](https://police.wvu.edu/clery-act/campus-safety/crime-log) that outputs a CSV file. The log itself contains the previous 90 days' worth of incidents, so this would be useful for storing information before it disappears from the site.
